Notes:
- For reference, how the analog version works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4

Potential Roadblocks:
- Asynchronous programming has been a challenge for me in the past, but I'm confident that I can clear any hurdles needed here for this project.
- Reproducing the shapes of the game and buttons could be a challenge.
    - SVG or styled divs for this?
- Obtaining sound samples.

Stretch Goals:
- Keep track of best round
- Make it responsive
    - Possibly re-design layout/feel of buttons for mobile versions or for all versions.
- Have player choose difficulty level with expanded button options (can expand to more than 3)

Feedback:
- jquery logic does not transfer 100% to mobile
- mobile version of might require different logic / event handlers.
